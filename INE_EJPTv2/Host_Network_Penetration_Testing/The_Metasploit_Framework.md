# Overview
The Metasploit Framework (MSF) is one of the most widely used exploitation tools used by penetration testers and security researchers. MSF is an open-source, robust penetration testing and exploitation framework that is used by penetration testers and security researchers. It provides a robust infrastructure to automate every stage of the penetration testing life cycle. The MSF is designed to be modular allowing for new functionality to be implemented and tested.
