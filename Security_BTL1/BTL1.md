#  Phishing-Analysis

## Types
- Recon Emails
	- Spam
		- check if email is valid, error messages
	- Social Engineering
		- Try to get a response
		- impersonation
	- Tracking pixel
		- embedded code that will reach out to a server
		- gather data
			- OS and client information
			- time to read/open
			- ip address
- Credential Harvester
	- Impersonate legit website login pages
	- gathers username/password
- Social Engineering
	- checks for response
	- impersonation to get money etc...
	- gathers information
- Vishing and Smishing
	- Vishing - voice phishing
		- voice call impersonation
		- trys to get money/information
	- Smishing - SMS phishing
		- text message impersonation
		- trys to get money/information
- Whaling
	- targeted phishing attack on important personnel
	- CEO, CFO, CTO, etc...
- Malicous File
	- Office Macros
	- Hosted Malware download
		- can use compromised domain
- Spam
	- normal non-malicious junk email
## Tactics
- Spear Phishing
	- Targeted to a specific user
	- Gathers information on target to be more convincing 
- Impersonation
	- acts/pretends to be another person
- Typosquatting and Homographs
	- Typosquatting
		- impersonating a legit site with minor typo differences
		- IE. I replaced with l, missing char or extra char
	- Homographs
		- uses different char encoding that looks identical to the eye
		- Latin ‚Äúo‚Äù and the Cyrillic ‚Äúo‚Äù
- Sender Spoofing
	- spoof from field in email header
- Hyperlinks
	- embedded malicious links
- Business Email Compromise
## Investigating
- Artifacts
	- Email Info
		- sending address
		- subject line
		- recipient address
		- server ip & reverse DNS
		- Reply-To adress
		- date & time
	- File Info
		- name
		- hash
	- Web Info
		- urls
		- root domains
## Defensive
- Security Technology
	- SPF (sender policy framework)
		- type of DNS TXT record, shows allowed domains
	- DKIM (domain keys identified mail)
		- hash check for integrity of email
	- DMARC (domain-based message authentication, reporting & conformance)
		- builds on SPF & DKIM, allows to specify what happens when checks are failed.
- Spam Filter
	- content
	- rule-based
	- Bayesian
	- attachment
	- sandboxing
- Blocking Artifacts
	- Email sender
	- Sender domain
	- sender server ip
	- subject line
- Blocking File Artifacts
	- hashes
	- names
## Report Writing
- Artifacts collected
	- Sanitize artifacts
- Tools used and results
- Defensive measures taken
## Tools
- URL2PNG
- URLScan
- VirusTotal
- ThreatFeeds
- Talos File Reputation
- Hybrid Analysis
- PhishTool
