Metasploit Framework
# Overview

- Interface : Methods of interacting with the MSF
- Module : pieces of code that perform a particular task such as an exploit
- Vulnerability : Weakness or flaw in a system that can be exploited
- Exploit : Piece of code/module that is used to take advantage of a vulnerability
- Payload: piece of code delivered to the target by an expoit with the objective of executing arbitrary commands or providing remote access to attacker.
- Listener : a utility that listens for an incoming connection from a target

---

# Architecture
## Interfaces
- `msfconsole` : All in one interface to the MSF
- `MSFcli` : Command line interface that is useful for scripting, deprecated in 2015 and the functionality migrated into the MSFconsole.
- Armitage : A free java based GUI for the MSF
- Web : web interface

## Modules
A module is a piece of code that can be utilized by the MSF. Libraries facilitate the execution of modules.
- Exploit : A module use to take advantage, usually paired with a payload
- Payload : code delivered to target to take advantage, example is reverse shell
	- Non-staged : payload that is sent to target along with the exploit
	- Staged Payload : first payload contains reverse shell, second part is then downloaded and executed
		- Stagers : used to establish stable connection
		- Stage: payload components that are downloaded
- Encoder : used to encode payloads in order to avoid AV detection
- NOP : used to ensure that payloads sizes are consistent and stability
- Auxiliary : used to perform additional functionality like port scanning and enumeration
### Meterpreter Payload
The meterpreter (meta-interpreter) payload is an advanced multi-functional payload that is executed in memory on the target system. It communicates over a stager socket and provides an attacker with an interactive command interpreter on the target system that facilitates the execution of system commands, file navigation and manipulation key-logging, and etc...
